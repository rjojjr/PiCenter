# PiCenter

Smart home statistics, control, integration and 
prediction center.

This application is built around Nest thermostat(Looks like it won't
be compatible now. Thanks Google) and Raspberry Pi with various 
sensors and electronic components.

The core of this program will be an analytical engine,
that will calculate various statistics and hopefully make 
accurate predictions, and draw useful conclusions within
a decent realm of certainty.

Initially the program will be built around temperature,
and predicting ways to increase efficiency. We will slowly
add features like lighting and such, and when time allows, 
controlling ductwork and windows.

Please feel free to contribute features pertaining to
your own smart home incorporation.

The program is built with Springboot, React, Redux, axios and py4j
Python Java gateway API to incorporate the Raspberry Pi.

Branches will be named by toDo-<ToDo number> or bug-<Bug number> or s-<Story number>
